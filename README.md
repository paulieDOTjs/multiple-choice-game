# multiple-choice-game

A dynamic multiple choice game. The user begins the game in the start screen. When the start game is clicked the user is shown the rules of score keeping on the game and prompted for a username. The user can jump straight to the high score window or enter a username and take the quiz. The user is presented with 5 music theory questions, each more difficult than the last as a timer ticks down. Upon completing the quiz the user is brought to the high score page.
